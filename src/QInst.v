 instantiating a quantified theorem with <implb> *)
Lemma impl_split a b:
  implb a b = true -> orb (negb a) b = true.
Proof.
  intro H.
  destruct a; destruct b; trivial.
(* alternatively we could do <now verit_base H.> but it forces us to have veriT
   installed when we compile SMTCoq. *)

   or into a <or (not b) c> when instantiating such a quantified theorem *)
Lemma impl_or_split_right a b c:

Proof.

Proof.
